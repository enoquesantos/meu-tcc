 * @brief The PluginManager class has follow responsibilities:
 * 1: Manage the application plugins available from plugins directory. The plugins directory is specific from each platform:
 *  in Linux desktop, the plugins will be placed in appplication executable dir;
 *  in android, will be placed in assets:/plugins/;
 *  in ios/osx will be placed in assets_catalogs:/plugins/.
 * 2: Handle the plugins database table criation, if any of the plugins has a 'plugin_table.sql' file in your directory.
 * 3: Handle all plugins and application files cache deletion, when application are updated.
 * 4: When load all plugins, save in local settings the plugins pages list, to be used by follow QML components:
 *      Navigation Drawer menu retrieve the 'pages' list to show the options to the user;
 *      When app uses TabBar (specify in config.json), the 'pages' will be used to show the tab buttons to user navigate in application.
 * 5: The Login and Home pages will be defined by some plugin, and will be saved in local settings to application window load in PageStack or SwipeView.
 * 5: Save the app version, used to decide when delete and reload all plugins and to optimize the app start'up.
 *      If app not updated (the version is the same of previous execution), abort and the object will be deleted by App instance (the parent of PluginManager).
 *      Otherwise, load all plugins and save in local settings.
